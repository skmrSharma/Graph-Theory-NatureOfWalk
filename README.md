# To indicate the nature of walk
+ Only **Trail** : edges do not repeat but vertices should repeat
+ Only **Open Walk** : both edges and vertices must repeat
+ **Path** : both edges and vertices do not repeat
+ **Cycle** : A closed walk in which both edges and vertices do not repeat
+ Only **Circuit** : A closed walk in which edges do not repeat but vertices should repeat

## Inputs
+ Number of nodes in the graph should not be greater than 10
+ The walk whose type is to be determined must be given as a sequence of vertices
+ An example input is provided in the file - graph_input3

## Output would be one of the above
