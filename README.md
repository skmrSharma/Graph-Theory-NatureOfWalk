# To indicate the nature of walk
+ Only **Trail** : edges do not repeat but vertices should repeat
+ Only **Open Walk** : both edges and vertices must repeat
+ **Path** : both edges and vertices do not repeat
+ **Cycle** : A closed walk in which both edges and vertices do not repeat
+ Only **Circuit** : A closed walk in which edges do not repeat but vertices should repeat

## Input should be given by the user but the graphs are given by us
